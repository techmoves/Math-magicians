<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.


# üìñ Math magician <a name="about-project"></a>
### `npm run build`


> I developed a leaderboard using React, and APIs. This project aims to create a simple and intuitive interface that allows users to perform math task in a style manner.üëå
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.


The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!


## üõ† Built With <a name="built-with"></a>
See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.


### Tech Stack <a name="tech-stack"></a>
### `npm run eject`


- HTML-5
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
- CSS3
- Java Script ES 6
- Linters
- webpack
- React 
- babel


<details>
If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
  <summary>Client</summary>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config/tree/master/html-css-js">Linters</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">HTML</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/">CSS</a></li>
  </ul> 
</details>


Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.


<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>
You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
### Code Splitting


## üíª Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>
This section has moved here: [https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/code-splitting](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/code-splitting)


- To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.
### Analyzing the Bundle Size


### Prerequisites
This section has moved here: [https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/analyzing-the-bundle-size](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/analyzing-the-bundle-size)


- You only need a browser to run the html file in.
### Making a Progressive Web App
-  A web browser: You will need a modern web browser such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Safari to view and test your project.
A code editor: You will need a code editor such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom to write, edit, and manage your project's files.
A local server: You will need a local server such as XAMPP or WAMP to run your project locally and test it on your own computer.
Knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: You will need to have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in order to build a web development project.
Familiarity with Git and GitHub: If you are using Git and GitHub to manage your project's codebase, you will need to be familiar with how to use them.


### Setup
This section has moved here: [https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/making-a-progressive-web-app](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/making-a-progressive-web-app)


- Create a new folder to store the files in.
### Advanced Configuration
- Open a command-line interface (e.g. Terminal on Mac or Linux, Command Prompt on Windows).
Navigate to the folder where you want to clone the repository using the cd command.
Use the git clone command followed by the repository's URL to clone the repository. For example: git clone https://github.com/techmoves/math-magicians.git
Press enter and wait for the repository to finish cloning.


### Install

Install this project with:
### Deployment


- Open your command prompt or terminal and run.
This section has moved here: [https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment)


- git clone  [ https://github.com/techmoves/math-magicians.git]
### `npm run build` fails to minify


- Clone the repository to your local machine using the git clone command as described in the previous answer.
This section has moved here: [https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting#npm-run-build-fails-to-minify](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting#npm-run-build-fails-to-minify)
Navigate to the project folder using a command-line interface such as Terminal or Command Prompt.
Install any necessary dependencies using a package manager such as NPM or Yarn. You can do this by running the npm install or yarn install command in the project folder.
Start the local server using a command such as npm start or yarn start, depending on the project's setup.
Open a web browser and navigate to the local server's URL to view and test the project.
-

### Usage

- Assuming that you have installed the project's dependencies and started the local server, you can run the project by following these steps:

Open a web browser such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Safari.
In the address bar, type the URL of the local server that you started in the previous step. This will typically be something like http://localhost:3000.
Press enter to navigate to the local server's URL.
The project should now be running in your web browser. Use the website's interface to interact with the project and test its functionality.

### Run tests

To run tests, run the following command:

- To run tests run :
- npx hint .
- npx stylelint "\*_/_.{css,scss}"
- modules


###  Key Features <a name="Key-features"></a>
- Added index.html file
- Added styles.css
- Added index.js file
-  Used Modular JS
- React apps
